# AD-CRM-Connector
The AD Connector should provide the ability to synchronize users from Active Directory to Microsoft CRM 2016 On Premise and newer versions. Based on the configuration, the tool should be able to identify users who need to be synchronized by their group associations. The group association will also be used to connect the user in CRM to the appropriated security roles and teams. The business unit for the user in CRM will be mapped to the organizational unit of the user in the Active Directory. Changes in the Active Directory regarding the user will be synchronized to CRM. But there will be a possibility to exclude users from the synchronization to manage the user manually within CRM.
